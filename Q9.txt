In this challenge, we learn about Arrays. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task
Complete the getSecondLargest function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array, nums, of n numbers. The function must find and return the second largest number in nums.

Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the nums array.

The second line contains n space-separated numbers describing the elements in nums.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10
0 <= nums <= 100, where nums is the number at index i.
The numbers in are not distinct.
Output Format
Return the value of the second largest number in the nums array.

Sample Input 0
1
2
5
2 3 6 6 5
##Sample Output 0

1
5
Explanation
Given the array nums = [2,3,6,6,5], we see that the largest value in the array is 6 and the second largest value is 5. Thus, we return 5 as our answer.
