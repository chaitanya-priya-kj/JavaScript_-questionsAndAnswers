Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, score, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her grade according to the following rules:

If (25 < score <= 30), then grade = A.
If (20 < score <= 25), then grade = B.
If (15 < score <= 20), then grade = C.
If (10 < score <= 15), then grade = D.
If (5 < score <= 10), then grade = E.
If (0 < score <= 5), then grade = F.

Input Format
Stub code in the editor reads a single integer denoting score from stdin and passes it to the function.


Constraints
0 <= score <= 30

Output Format
The function must return the value of grade (i.e., the letter grade) that Julia earned on the exam.


Sample Input 0
1
11

Sample Output 0
1
D

Explanation
Because score = 11, it satisfies the condition (10 < score <= 15) (which corresponds to D). Thus, we return D as our answer.
